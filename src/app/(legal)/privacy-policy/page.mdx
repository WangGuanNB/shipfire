# Privacy Policy for Miniatur AI

## Introduction

Welcome to Miniatur AI — an advanced artificial intelligence platform that transforms ordinary photographs into stunning miniature masterpieces using cutting-edge computer vision and machine learning algorithms. Your privacy matters to us. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have when using Miniatur AI.

## Information We Collect and How We Use It

1. **Image Files and Processing**

   - **What We Collect**: Images (JPEG/PNG) that you upload for miniature transformation (up to 10MB).
   - **How We Process**: Our AI algorithms analyze image depth, perspective, and composition to create professional-quality tilt-shift effects and miniature scenes. Processing occurs on secure cloud infrastructure optimized for AI image processing.
   - **Storage**: We do not permanently store your uploaded images. Images are temporarily processed for transformation and automatically deleted after completion. Downloads and exports are delivered directly to your browser.

2. **Account Information (if you create an account)**

   - **What We Collect**: Your name, email address, and other basic details you provide.
   - **Purpose**: To manage your account, deliver customer support, and provide any account‑related features you opt into.

3. **Usage Details**

   - **What We Collect**: Interactions within the app (e.g., features used, settings toggled), aggregated session data, and timestamps.
   - **Purpose**: To understand feature usage, improve performance, and guide product decisions.

4. **Device Information**

   - **What We Collect**: Device type, operating system, browser type/version, and basic technical diagnostics.
   - **Purpose**: To ensure compatibility, debug issues, and optimize performance across devices.

5. **Cookies and Local Storage**

   - **What We Store**: Preferences (e.g., theme, locale, recent settings), session state, and optional analytics identifiers.
   - **Purpose**: To keep the experience fast and consistent, remember your choices, and analyze anonymized usage trends.

6. **Payment and Billing Information (if applicable)**

   - **What We Collect**: Payment method details, billing address, and transaction metadata if you purchase premium features.
   - **Purpose**: To process transactions, manage entitlements, and comply with financial laws. Payments are handled through trusted providers.

## Data Storage and Security

We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information. Where processing occurs in‑browser, your images and conversions stay on your device by default. For any data we do store, we employ encryption in transit, access controls, and monitoring. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell your personal information. We may share limited data:

- **Service Providers**: With vetted vendors who assist in operating the service (e.g., AI processing, analytics, payments), bound by confidentiality obligations.
- **Legal Compliance**: To comply with laws, regulations, or valid legal processes.
- **Protection**: To protect the rights, property, or safety of our users, the public, or Miniatur AI.
- **Aggregated Insights**: We may share anonymized, aggregated statistics that do not identify individuals.

## Your Choices and Rights

- **Preferences**: You can manage cookies/local storage through your browser settings. Some features may rely on these settings to function.
- **Access and Deletion**: If you have an account, you can request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal information.
- **Opt‑out**: You may opt out of non‑essential analytics where available.

## Children’s Privacy

Miniatur AI is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, contact us and we will take appropriate action.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post the updated version on this page and update the effective date, if provided. Your continued use of the service after changes become effective signifies your acceptance of the revised policy.
