# Privacy Policy for Graffiti Generator

## Introduction

Welcome to Graffiti Generator — an advanced artificial intelligence platform that transforms ordinary text into stunning street art and graffiti designs using cutting-edge AI algorithms and professional graffiti font technology. Your privacy matters to us. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have when using Graffiti Generator.

## Information We Collect and How We Use It

1. **Text Input and Processing**

   - **What We Collect**: Text content that you input for graffiti generation (names, slogans, brand text, etc.).
   - **How We Process**: Our AI algorithms analyze text structure, apply professional graffiti fonts, and generate street art designs with customizable colors and effects. Processing occurs on secure cloud infrastructure optimized for real-time graffiti generation.
   - **Storage**: We do not permanently store your text inputs or generated graffiti designs. Text is temporarily processed for generation and automatically cleared after completion. Downloads and exports are delivered directly to your browser.

2. **Account Information (if you create an account)**

   - **What We Collect**: Your name, email address, and other basic details you provide.
   - **Purpose**: To manage your account, deliver customer support, and provide any account‑related features you opt into.

3. **Usage Details**

   - **What We Collect**: Interactions within the app (e.g., features used, settings toggled), aggregated session data, and timestamps.
   - **Purpose**: To understand feature usage, improve performance, and guide product decisions.

4. **Device Information**

   - **What We Collect**: Device type, operating system, browser type/version, and basic technical diagnostics.
   - **Purpose**: To ensure compatibility, debug issues, and optimize performance across devices.

5. **Cookies and Local Storage**

   - **What We Store**: Preferences (e.g., theme, locale, recent settings), session state, and optional analytics identifiers.
   - **Purpose**: To keep the experience fast and consistent, remember your choices, and analyze anonymized usage trends.

6. **Payment and Billing Information (if applicable)**

   - **What We Collect**: Payment method details, billing address, and transaction metadata if you purchase premium features.
   - **Purpose**: To process transactions, manage entitlements, and comply with financial laws. Payments are handled through trusted providers.

## Data Storage and Security

We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information. Where processing occurs in‑browser, your text inputs and graffiti designs stay on your device by default. For any data we do store, we employ encryption in transit, access controls, and monitoring. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell your personal information. We may share limited data:

- **Service Providers**: With vetted vendors who assist in operating the service (e.g., AI processing, analytics, payments), bound by confidentiality obligations.
- **Legal Compliance**: To comply with laws, regulations, or valid legal processes.
- **Protection**: To protect the rights, property, or safety of our users, the public, or Graffiti Generator.
- **Aggregated Insights**: We may share anonymized, aggregated statistics that do not identify individuals.

## Your Choices and Rights

- **Preferences**: You can manage cookies/local storage through your browser settings. Some features may rely on these settings to function.
- **Access and Deletion**: If you have an account, you can request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal information.
- **Opt‑out**: You may opt out of non‑essential analytics where available.

## Children's Privacy

Graffiti Generator is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, contact us and we will take appropriate action.

## Changes to This Policy
